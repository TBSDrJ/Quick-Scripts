# Quick-Scripts

Some quick scripts to automate some simple tasks.

1. AdvHonorsShuffle.py and HonorsShuffle.py
  *. These create awesome dance moves.
  *. No, really, they shuffle the class into meeting slots for consecutive one-on-one meetings.
  *. Notice the first line of each file; if I use chmod to make hese exectuable, it allows me to run them from command-line without having to type 'python3' first.  It also means that it always uses python3, instead of defaulting to python2 and throwing an error message, which happens approximately every simgle time for me.
